## Changelog

### February 21, 2026
- Restored the YouTube section to a simpler earlier layout and removed experimental helper styles (`box-drop`, `enhanced-shadow`, `muted-note`).
- Removed the temporary `README.d` changelog file and merged relevant notes into this `README.md`.
- Kept the `glass-effect` styling on the YouTube container and restored the embedded YouTube iframe and subscribe widget.
- Committed and pushed these changes to the `main` branch on the remote `origin` repository.

If you'd like a more detailed changelog entry or a separate `CHANGELOG.md` file formatted for release notes, I can add that as well.

> **Note**: The current static website would remain fully functional during development, allowing for gradual migration to the Django-powered version.
